# Design Pattern

## Core Object-Oriented Principles

* **Encapsulate what varies**
  Identify aspects of your application that change frequently and isolate them from what stays the same.

* **Favor composition over inheritance**
  Build behavior by composing objects instead of relying on rigid inheritance hierarchies.

* **Program to interfaces, not implementations**
  Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete classes to reduce coupling and increase flexibility.

## Design Pattern

**Strategy Pattern**:
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
