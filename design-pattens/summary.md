# Design Pattern

## Core Object-Oriented Principles

* **Encapsulate what varies**
  Identify aspects of your application that change frequently and isolate them from what stays the same.

* **Favor composition over inheritance**
  Build behavior by composing objects instead of relying on rigid inheritance hierarchies.

* **Program to interfaces, not implementations**
  Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete classes to reduce coupling and increase flexibility.

* **Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.**
  Loose coupling minimise interdependency and create flexible OO design

* **Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

## Design Pattern

**Strategy Pattern**:
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

**Observer Pattern**:
The **Observer Pattern** defines a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Decorator Pattern**:
The **Decorator Pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
